1
0:00:00,000 --> 0:00:04,680
Targeting me won't get their money back. I knew the mob wouldn't go down without a fight, but this is different.

2
0:00:04,680 --> 0:00:05,840
They've crossed the line.

3
0:00:05,840 --> 0:00:10,640
You crossed the line first, sir. You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation.

4
0:00:10,640 --> 0:00:15,240
And in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.

5
0:00:15,240 --> 0:00:21,240
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred. We just need to figure out what he's after.

6
0:00:21,240 --> 0:00:26,240
We respect Master Wayne. Perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.

7
0:00:26,240 --> 0:00:33,240
A long time ago, I was in Burma. My friends and I were working for the local government.

8
0:00:33,240 --> 0:00:38,240
They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones.

9
0:00:38,240 --> 0:00:43,240
But their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

10
0:00:43,240 --> 0:00:46,240
So we went looking for the stones.

11
0:00:46,240 --> 0:00:52,240
But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him.

12
0:00:52,240 --> 0:00:59,240
One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine.

13
0:00:59,240 --> 0:01:04,240
The bandit had been throwing them away.

14
0:01:04,240 --> 0:01:06,240
So why steal them?

15
0:01:06,240 --> 0:01:12,240
Well, because he thought it was good sport. Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money.

16
0:01:12,240 --> 0:01:17,240
They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with.

17
0:01:17,240 --> 0:01:22,240
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
