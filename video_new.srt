1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,671
Targeting me won't get their money back.

2
00:00:01,671 --> 00:00:04,680
 I knew the mob wouldn't go down without a fight, but this is different.

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:05,840
They've crossed the line.

4
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,407
You crossed the line first, sir.

5
00:00:07,407 --> 00:00:10,640
 You squeezed them, you hammered them to the point of desperation.

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:15,240
And in their desperation, they turned to a man they didn't fully understand.

7
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,981
Criminals aren't complicated, Alfred.

8
00:00:17,981 --> 00:00:21,240
 We just need to figure out what he's after.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,721
We respect Master Wayne.

10
00:00:22,721 --> 00:00:26,240
 Perhaps this is a man you don't fully understand either.

11
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,785
A long time ago, I was in Burma.

12
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:33,240
 My friends and I were working for the local government.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:38,240
They were trying to buy the loyalty of tribal leaders by bribing them with precious stones.

14
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:43,240
But their caravans were being raided in a forest north of Rangoon by a bandit.

15
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:46,240
So we went looking for the stones.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:52,240
But in six months, we never met anyone who traded with him.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:59,240
One day, I saw a child playing with a ruby the size of a tangerine.

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,240
The bandit had been throwing them away.

19
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:06,240
So why steal them?

20
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,607
Well, because he thought it was good sport.

21
00:01:08,607 --> 00:01:12,240
 Because some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money.

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,240
They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,240
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
