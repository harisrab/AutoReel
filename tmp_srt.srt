1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
They call for you.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The general, he became a slave.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
The slave who became a gladied.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,000
The gladied of the defied emperor.

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Striking story.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Now that people want to know how the story ends,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
only a famous death will do.

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:39,000
What could be more glorious than to challenge the emperor himself in the greater arena?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
You fight me.

10
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
Why not?

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Do you think I'm afraid?

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I think you've been afraid all your life.

13
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I might not be invincible.

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Who knows no fear?

15
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Your man or one said death smiles at the ball.

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
All the man can do a smile back.

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
No wonder.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Did your friend smile at his own death?

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You must know.

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,000
You were your father.

21
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
You loved my father, I know.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
But so did I.

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,000
That makes us tough, doesn't it?

24
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Smile for me now, brother.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
The gods have spared you.

26
00:01:33,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Don't you understand?
